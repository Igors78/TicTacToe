their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a
solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. Please
follow the prompt to enter your move. Your cross (X) or your (O) will be placed
in the cell with corresponding number you enter, check reference board.
